# Mullaeinstant Web Project

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/eunchurn/mullae-instant.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eunchurn/mullae-instant.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eunchurn/mullae-instant)

## Description

\#mullaeinstant\_ explores the modus operandi of an art “work”. It traces how the various activities of creation taking place in Mullae, a space of the real, come to be saved, circulated, reproduced and dispersed through the cyber space, a visual field to be manipulated as well as an apparatus that mediates them all. #mullaeinstant_ is thus an experiment on the physical/conceptual elasticity of the stage. It has been selected as part of “2019 MEET” organized by Seoul Foundation of Arts and Culture and Seoul Art Space Mullae, and sponsored by GS SHOP.
