# \#stage

> All the worldâ€™s a stage,

> And all the men and women merely players;

> They have their exits and their entrances;

> And one man in his time plays many parts

> \[â€¦\]

> Last scene of all,

> That ends this strange eventful history,

> Is second childishness and mere oblivion;

> Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

- William Shakespeare, As You Like It
