2) Excerpts from Susan Sontag's "Notes on Camp"

> *10. Camp sees everything in quotation marks. It’s not a lamp, but a “lamp”; not a woman, but a “woman.” To perceive Camp in objects and persons is to understand Beings-as-Playing-a-Role. It is the farthest extension, in sensibility, of the metaphor of life as theater.*


> *32. Camp is the glorification of “character.” The statement is of no importance - except, of course, to the person (Loie Fuller, Gaud, Cecil B. De Mille, Crivelli, de Gaulle, etc.) who makes it. What the Camp eye appreciates is the unity, the force of the person. In every move the aging Martha Graham makes she’s being Martha Graham, etc., etc… This is clear in the case of the great serious idol of Camp taste, Greta Garbo. Garbo’s incompetence (at the least, lack of depth) as an actress enhances her beauty. She’s always herself.*
